    <h1>Cities I Want to Visit</h1>
    <body>I want to visit Hamburg because a good friend of mine from the Captain's Career Course (CCC) is from there, and I also majored in German in my undergrad. I would like to visit London because that same friend now lives in the UK. I have always wanted to visit NYC because it intrigues me.</body>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Hamburg, Germany</em></li>
      <li><strong>London, UK</strong></li>
      <li><em>New York, NY</em></li>
    </ol>
