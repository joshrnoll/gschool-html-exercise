  <h1>Cities I Want to Visit</h1>
  <p>I want to visit Hamburg because a good friend of mine from the Captain's Career Course (CCC) is from there, and I also majored in German in my undergrad. I would like to visit London because that same friend now lives in the UK. I have always wanted to visit NYC because it intrigues me.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Hamburg, Germany</em></li>
    <li><strong>London, UK</strong></li>
    <li><em>New York, NY</em></li>
  </ol>
